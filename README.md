## Overview and Origin

The company I decided to research was RobinHood Markets INC. The company was incorparted in 2013 and founded by two Standford graduates, Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. The idea for this company came after the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement where the founders did some soul searching and tried to create a system in which the average joe can invest in the stock market and make an earning. The company is funded primarly through Rebates from Market Makers, their premium subscription service RobinHood Gold, stock loans, income generated from cash, and finally Cash Management.

## Business Activities:

The company aims to accomplish the leveling of the playing field between the average person and the average wallstreet broker. They wanted to make investing as simple as possible so that anyone can access it. Their intended customers are anyone and everyone that has the funds to invest. They want to essentially look out for the "little guy". The market size is potenially limitless since its accesibility and overall message appeals to everyone who is interested in making financial moves. The biggest thing this company offers that other competitors don't is its easy to access interface and also no commission fees or minimum balances- which at the time was considered a disrupting force in the market since many traders made billions off those kind of fees. RobinHood is currently using 25 different technolgies such as HTML5, Google Fonts, and Google Analytics. These technologies are used for creating the interface for the application, especially for the mobile format.


## Landscape:

The company falls under the robo advisors and personal finance domain (specfically the latter). The major trends within this sector include bite sized investing. Which is the equivalent of paying a small part of a high value share. RobinHood was one of the first prominent companies to implement this. Also Cryptocurrencies have also been a huge major trend with many companies offering the option of investing into crypto. RobinHood in paticular offers a myriad of options when investing into that paticular catergory. Some of its competitors include ETRADE, WeBull, TD Ameritrade, and SoFi investing. 


## Results

The biggest impact this company has had so far is due to its success, many other firms and personal financial instituions have also lowerd their brokerage fees to $0 in order to compete with RobinHood, which caused a huge shift in the industry and dried up many revenue sources for larger stock brokerage firms, shifting the landscape of investing towards the common man. The core metrics to measure RobinHood success can be applied to many things and there are many ways to show it. I would say the main ones are user growth, in which RobinHood has had 31 million accounts, which 18 of them being funded. Compared to its competitors, its actually starting to gain ground. For example, Charles Schwab currently is the largest and has 32.1 million accounts. Another metric we can use is Revenue and Payment for Order Flow. The company made $959 Million last year from retail trading, Q1 2021 they made 522 million, with projected revenues being on track towards $2 billion by the end of the year. Compared to its biggest competitor, Charles Schwab, which reported $4.7 Billion in Q1.



## Recommendations

Personally I believe they need to offer more investing advice- for free. They do have RobinHood gold which can qualify as an robo advisor tool since it gives you research and tools you need. However, going off the company image and mission statement about making investing easier, they need to place an emphasis on essentially making the playing field as level as possible without additional cost. I believe by doing so, more and more people will take risks in the stock market and regardless of their results, RobinHood will essentially be making that revenue regardless. I believe having a third party or in-house robo advisor that updates in real time the volatility of stocks and wheter it is a safe investment or not would be ideal. RobinHood does this already tos ome degree but in my opinion not enough as I would like. If they are truly about the common man, then they need to dumb it down as much as possible for the average joe. The technolgoies used can include again, third party applications sponsored by their company, or an in house section in their app dedicated to exactly that.
